This folder contains the STL files used in building the payload package as outlined in this project.

## plates gps
This folder contains the options for your SAM and ZOE choices. The rest of the stack is not relevant to the choice of GPS.

## plates no-sensors
This folder contains the battery and controller stack when you are not using a sensor layer. There is an option to have a 
slightly shorter stack if you're using the SAM GPS module above the feather plate module.

## plates sensors
This folder contains the battery, sensor and controller stack when you are using a sensor layer. There is an option to have 
a slightly shorter stack if you're using the SAM GPS module above the feather plate module.

## servo all
If you are doing the parachute control section, you will need all of these pieces regardless of the size of servo you use.

## servo large
The STL files used for the larger 9g servo.

## servo tiny
The STL files used for the 2g micro-servo.
