## Things to do
You  will need to create a file called `myConfig.py` and add a Google Maps API key.

```
apikey = "YOUR KEY IN HERE"
```

Google more details, but your applications will be on your [Google Apps API console](https://code.google.com/apis/console) and you will need to add the Maps Javascript API key.

Then copy any of the flight data files (CSV) into this directory and run the python script:

```
> python3 dolaunch.py
```

You will then have the HTML map view, speed and altitude chart. These will also be zipped up as well.
